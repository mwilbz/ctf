# Overview

X-MAS CTF 2019 was a 1 week long online CTF, hosted by team [HTsP](https://ctftime.org/team/58218). There were a ton of fun problems and experimental categories, like Quantum, Emulators, and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).

It was also my first CTF! I played solo and was pretty happy with my results, ending in 53rd place out of 2000+ participating teams. My score breadown below makes it clear that I have a lot to learn in some areas of security/hacking.
